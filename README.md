Ivan Soto here (Contact: ivan.soto@live.com Washington, DC metro area, 2021-12-26 Sunday) ... I'm currently
interested in programming that supports Web Pages, particularly JavaScript, both in the browsers and in the
server(s). My long-time interest in "the three biggies," Java, C#, C++ continues, along with the
general-purpose supporting cast of database languages, both relational and object-centered.

Although I'm nominally (meaning: in name only) retired, I still like to maintain engagement within the
limited areas of information processing technologies I mentioned. (Add to that Office suite work, as user
and as VBA developer.)
